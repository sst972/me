  <summary><b>Power BI</b></summary>
  <br>
  <p>I completed the Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI course on <a href = "https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT207x+2T2019/course/">edX.org</a>. Power BI is a cloud-based analytics tool with various components to help business analysts and decision makers. Data in Power BI also updates automatically. In this course I learned best practices on modeling various data types, creating strategic dashboards, and integrating outside tools into Power BI. This course, coupled with an example project, allowed me to understand the uses of Power BI as an overall communication tool – communicating business status, needs, and histories. Topics included in the course are:
  <ul>
    <li>Manipulating and modeling data</li>
    <li>Graphs, slicers, and conditional formatting</li>
    <li>Dashboards in Power BI Service</li>
    <li>Excel with Power BI</li>

  <summary><b>Linux</b></summary>
  <br>
  <p>I completed Linux Academy's <a href = "https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/346">LPI Linux Essentials Certification</a>. I learned the structure of the Linux system, how to run commands on the command line, and practical security implications.

  <ul>
    <li>Kernel definition and naming conventions</li>
    <li>Basic commands (pwd, cd, ls, cat, history, etc.)</li>
    <li>User permissions (read, write, execute, etc.)</li>

  <p>I also downloaded VirtualBox to create a virtual machine that runs Ubuntu using these <a href = "https://sal-a.github.io/vbox-ubuntu/#2-download-an-iso-file-for-ubuntu-from-httpsubuntucomdownloaddesktop">instructions</a>. On this VM, I set up my own AlgoVPN using these <a href = "https://github.com/trailofbits/algo">instructions</a>. This screenshot displays (left to right) my host IP address, AlgoVPN IP address, and DigitalOcean droplet:

  <br>
  <p>I completed Linux Academy's <a href = "https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/241">AWS Essentials Course</a>, giving me practice in the AWS console and experience in a few tools and services. AWS has an enormous range of abilities and I was introduced to several core services, but I dove into IAM and EC2 with the VPN example at the bottom. The course utilized <a href = "https://interactive.linuxacademy.com/diagrams/ProjectOmega2.html">Project Omega</a> as the example for learning. The course includes modules on:
  <ul>
    <li>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>

  <summary><b>PowerShell</b></summary>
  <br>
  <p>I was first exposed to PowerShell through the LinkedIn Learning course <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/learning/powershell-5-essential-training/next-steps">PowerShell 5 Essential Training</a>. This course showed me how to use PowerShell and seek help on the command line if needed. This course also taught me about scripting and automation as well as remote management; both highly useful tools in any organization. PowerShell is essential for any Windows systems administrator and this course was a fantastic introduction to the world. It includes sections on:
  <ul>
    <li>PowerShell purpose, launching and commmandlets</li>
    <li>Understanding cmdlet syntax</li>
    <li>Resolving terse commands and discovering commands</li>

  <summary><b>Salesforce</b></summary>
  <br>
  <p>I completed the <a href = "https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/trails/force_com_admin_beginner">Admin Beginner</a> cource through Salesforce's Trailhead site. This was my favorite course because Salesforce was the easiest to understand and the content of Salesforce is quite useful. I felt like it was the perfect combination of Power BI and AWS (though that's not 'technically' correct). Salesforce is doing well in the marketplace with their marketing insight tools and abilities in user, data, report, and dashboard management. The course includes units on:
  <ul>
    <li>Salesforce Platform Basics</li>
    <li>Data Modeling and Management</li>
    <li>Lightning Experience Customization</li>
    <li>Salesforce Mobile App Customization</li>
    <li>User Engagement</li>
    <li>Reports & Dashboards for Lightning Experience</li>
  </ul>
